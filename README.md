This software learns the best of (finitely many) graphs for **semi-supervised learning** (within the framework of Belkin, Matveeva and Niyogi). These graphs may be constructed, for example, by applying a distance metric on points in Euclidean space and then computing k nearest neighbors or exponentially decaying weights. 

Our methodology is based on *multiple kernel learning* and the connection between *graph Laplacians* and *reproducing kernels*. 
The algorithm is described in the paper [Combining Graph Laplacians for Semi-Supervised Learning.](http://papers.nips.cc/paper/2938-combining-graph-laplacians-for-semi-supervised-learning.pdf)
The code also includes implementation of a few image transformations such as tangent distances.

To run the experiments from the paper execute `usps_experiments`
after downloading the USPS data set and creating the required mat files.
